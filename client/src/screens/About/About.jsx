              Salutations! Born and raised in Ohio, curently a North Carolina resident, I've tried to see as much of our planet as possible. When I'm not
              plotting my next great escape, I relax with my house plants and quietly enjoy the local trails and parks. I'm so exicted to have worked on Get Lost with my team.
              I'm especially thankful for the technincal accumen Evyn, Liz, and Mitchell bring--I've learned so much! On this project,
              I led the design, project managemnt, and UX/UI elements while also taking a leadership role in most of the styling. Even though my passion and strength is in styling, UX/UI, and project planning, I'm blessed to have such
              strong team memebers who are so talented in JS and React who took the time to teach me more about backend and component creation. I hope you enjoy your adventure through our site!

              Hey there! I'm a train-loving, theater making, code monkey that
              loves to travel and see new cities and places. Originally from
              Massachusetts, I am excited to be able to travel again soon.

              Hello fellow adventurers! Iâ€™m so glad to be a part of your
              journey! I'm a Colorado native and grew up playing in the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies offer a summertime playground where we camp,
              hike, mountain bike and rock climb, just to name a few cool
              ways to spend a day. Every new experience is an opportunity to learn
              more about ourselves and our world.
              I hope you enjoy traversing our site.  I led the creation of the component hierarchy and planning the technical layout of the site.  I headed up the back-end development, setting the foundation for the site.  The Digital Nomads team has been one of the highlights of my early development career.  Working with a team of talented professionals is a huge part of software engineering.  I've learned and grown a lot through the process of creating this web site.  I'm looking forward to future challenges!

              Hey there, thank you for taking the time to read about us! I go by
              Mitch. I am a bit of a nomad having lived on almost every coast of
              the US. Currently, I reside in Los Angeles where hikes and views
              are plentiful. The site was a joy to make, as we all have a
              combined interest in travel and exploration. Again, thanks for
              reading up on us, and don't forget to check the sale section!
