              Hello fellow adventurers! I’m so glad to be a part of your
              journey! I'm a Colorado native and have grown up playing in and
              caring for the Rocky Mountains. The Rockies aren't just for
              skiing. They offer a summertime playground too where we camp,
              hike, mountain bike and rock climb, just to name a few incredible
              activities that I enjoy. Whether we’re out for a day-long hike or
              trekking for days, every new experience is an opportunity to learn
              more about ourselves and our world. So throw on your pack and
              embark on your own incredible excursion!
